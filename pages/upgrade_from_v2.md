# Upgrading Ultimate URLs from a Version Prior to v3.0.0

v3.0.0 of Ultimate URLs (a.k.a. _USU_) makes a **major** change to both the plugin's installation procedures and the way it handles the generation of its alternate URLs.  This document identifies the steps you will need to take to remove previous versions' **core-file** changes and installation files _prior to_ any update to v3.0.0 or later &mdash; and, preferably, _prior to_ your store's update to Zen Cart 1.5.6 or later.

-----------

**Note**: If your store _still_ runs on Zen Cart 1.5.0 or earlier, the notifications required by _USU_ v3.0.0+ _**will not operate properly**_; you'll need to continue using your current installation of _USU_.

----------

There are two ways you can remove those previous _USU_ changes **before** you upgrade to v3.0.0; in either case, you should back-up your store's file-system _before_ proceeding!


1.  If your store (and _USU_) is running on a version of Zen Cart _prior to_ Zen Cart 1.5.6, run the _USU_ auto-uninstall that is distributed with your current version of _USU_.  Make note of your current configuration settings, so that you can apply them once you install _USU_ v3.0.0+.
2.  If you have already upgraded your store to Zen Cart 1.5.6 or later, you'll need to perform some file-related changes directly, as identified in the following sections.

## Manually Removing a Previous _USU_ Version

### Installation Files for Previous _USU_ Versions

To ensure that a previous installation of _USU_ doesn't mistakenly re-update itself, you'll need to delete the following files from your site's admin directory, noting that any use of `admin` in these instructions refers to your "secret" admin-directory's actual name:

1. `admin/includes/classes/usu_plugin.php`
1. `admin/includes/extra_configures/plugin.php`
1. `admin/includes/init_includes/init_usu_install.php`

### Zen Cart "Core File" Modifications

_USU_ v3.0.0 and later no longer requires any Zen Cart **core-file** modifications.  This section identifies the changes made to **core-files** by prior versions of _USU_.  Each modified file must either be _restored_ to its as-shipped version from your store's Zen Cart distribution, or _modified_ using a text-editor _before_ you install _USU_ v3.0.0+.

**Note:** In either case, make sure that each file doesn't have additional changes required by other add-ons currently installed in your store.  I'll suggest using, for each of the files listed below, a file-comparison tool (e.g. _WinMerge_ or _Beyond Compare_) to determine what changes have been made over-and-above your store's current Zen Cart version.

#### /includes/functions/html_output.php

Within that module's `zen_href_link` function, find and remove the following section:

```php
// START alternative URLs patch
    global $altURLs;
	$link = null;
    if(isset($altURLs)) {
      $link = $altURLs->href_link($page, $parameters, $connection, $add_session_id, $static, $use_dir_ws_catalog);
      if($link !== null) return $link;
    }
    // END alternative URLs patch
```

Check the `global` directive at the very beginning of the function, ensuring that the variables listed includes `$zco_notifier`, adding that variable name if not present.


If the following code block is not present at the beginning of the function, just after the `global` directive, add the code block at that point.

```php
    $link = null;
    $zco_notifier->notify('NOTIFY_SEFU_INTERCEPT', array(), $link, $page, $parameters, $connection, $add_session_id, $static, $use_dir_ws_catalog);
    if($link !== null) return $link;
``` 

#### /includes/init_includes/overrides/init_canonical.php

_USU_ no longer requires changes to this module, but there are other plugins that also distribute this override-file.  If you keep this file, be sure that you've updated it to reflect your current version of Zen Cart!

If none of your store's other plugins require this override, the file can be safely removed; otherwise, find the following block and remove it:

```php
/**
 * for canonicals generated by SEO_URLS (esp products linked to multiple categories):
 */
  case (isset($altURLs) && $altURLs->canonical !== null):
  	$canonicalLink = $altURLs->canonical;
    break;
```

#### /admin/includes/functions/html_output.php

Within that module's `zen_catalog_href_link` function, find and remove the following section:

```php
// START alternative URLs patch
    global $altURLs;
	$link = null;
    if(isset($altURLs)) {
      $link = $altURLs->href_link($page, $parameters, $connection, $add_session_id, $static, $use_dir_ws_catalog);
      if($link !== null) return $link;
    }
    // END alternative URLs patch
```

If the following code block is not present at the beginning of the function, just after the `function` statement, add the code block at that point.

```php
    global $zco_notifier;
    $link = null;
    $zco_notifier->notify('NOTIFY_SEFU_INTERCEPT_ADMCATHREF', array(), $link, $page, $parameters, $connection);
    if($link !== null) return $link;
```

#### /admin/categories.php

Find this code-block towards the beginning of the module and remove it:

```php
  // If the action will affect the cache entries
  if (preg_match("/(insert|update|setflag)/i", $action)) {
    usu_reset_cache_data('true');
  }
```


#### /admin/product.php

Find this code-block towards the beginning of the module and remove it:

```php
  // If the action will affect the cache entries
  if (preg_match("/(insert|update|setflag)/i", $action)) {
    usu_reset_cache_data('true');
  }
```
